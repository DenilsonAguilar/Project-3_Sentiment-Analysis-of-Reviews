# Project-3_Sentiment-Analysis-of-Reviews
This will contain a Jupyter Notebook which performs sentiment analysis on reviews using an API.

The notebook itself will view/display and make an analysis on reviews which are gathered from Yelp, it will included the following listed below but not the exact following order:

- An introduction (in Markdown): an overall question that I have about your dataset, along with my name and date and description of the problem and summary of my solution.
- It will use the API to search for reviews about resturants in Jersey City, NJ, a total of 20 to make up for 60. (Yelp Fusion only delivers 3 reviews per business.)
- Using the default Textblob analyzer and then compar NaiveBayesAnalyzer.
- It will perform sentiment analysis on these reviews using the TextBlob analyzer and the NaiveBayesAnalyzer,
- It will display a donut chart of the positive, negative, and neutral percentages for both the TextBlob and NaiveBayersAnalzyer. 
- It will delete the stop words from the reviews using the NLTK library stop-words lists.
- It will display a WordCloud of the top 20 words used in the reviews I cleaned.
- It will have a conclusion (in Markdown): include insights that I learned from this analysis.
