# Project-3_Sentiment-Analysis-of-Reviews
This will contain a Jupyter Notebook which performs sentiment analysis on reviews using an API.

The notebook itself will view/displaay and make an analysis on reviews which are gathered from Yelp, it will included the following listed below:

An introduction (in Markdown): an overall question that I have about your dataset, along with my name and date and description of the problem and summary of my solution.
It will use the API to search for reviews about mt topic. (Yelp Fusion only delivers 3 reviews per business.)
It will perform sentiment analysis on these reviews, displaying a donut chart of the positive, negative, and neutral percentages. Using the default Textblob analyzer and then compare it with the results of the NaiveBayesAnalyzer.
It will delete the stop words from the reviews using the NLTK library stop-words lists.
It will display a WordCloud of the top 20 words used in the reviews I cleaned.
It will have a conclusion (in Markdown): include insights that I learned from this analysis.


UPDATE: PLEASE WAIT UNTIL THURSDAY IF IN CASE THE NOTEBOOK IS NOT UPLOADED AS OF YET, IT'S RUNNING INTO SOME CODING ISSUES.
